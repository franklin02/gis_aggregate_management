# GIS Aggregate Management Project - User Manual

This document provides a comprehensive explanation of the modules in the GIS Aggregate Management Project. Each module’s 
function and data flow is explained, followed by a flowchart for a theoretical overview of the project.

## Project Overview

The GIS Aggregate Management Project manages and analyzes data related to aggregate material sources, quality, compliance, 
and operations. Using PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension, it automates Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) calculations 
and updates, enabling streamlined data processing and integration with GIS tools like ArcGIS.

## Project Modules and Data Flow

### 1. **Database Creation and Setup Module**

**Purpose**: 
This module initializes the database schema and enables spatial data handling capabilities with PostGIS.

**Key Scripts**:
- **`create_tables.sql`**: Creates tables including `Source`, `Material_Quality`, `Environmental_Compliance`, `Operational_Info`, 
and `UQ_Results`.
- **`automate_uq_updates.sql`**: Sets up the function and trigger for automated UQ metrics updates.

**Data Flow**:
1. **User runs `create_tables.sql`** to create the database structure.
2. **User runs `automate_uq_updates.sql`** to set up the trigger function for automated UQ calculations.
3. Once created, these tables are ready to accept data and perform automated updates.

---

### 2. **Data Population Module**

**Purpose**: 
Populates the database tables with initial data from CSV files.

**Key Script**:
- **`data_population.py`**: Loads data from `source_data.csv`, `material_quality.csv`, `environmental_compliance.csv`, and 
`operational_info.csv` into PostgreSQL.

**Data Flow**:
1. **User runs `data_population.py`**, which connects to the database.
2. The script reads each CSV file and inserts data into the appropriate table.
3. After data insertion, the database is populated with source, quality, compliance, and operational information, ready for UQ processing.

---

### 3. **UQ Calculation and Trigger Module**

**Purpose**:
Calculates and updates UQ metrics (Mean Value, Standard Deviation, and Reliability Index) for each `Source_ID` whenever data 
is inserted or updated in `Material_Quality`.

**Key Script**:
- **`uncertainty_model.py`** (optional): Runs standalone UQ calculations.
- **`automate_uq_updates.sql`**: Defines `update_uq_metrics` function and `recalculate_uq_after_insert` trigger.

**Data Flow**:
1. **When new data is added to `Material_Quality`**, the `recalculate_uq_after_insert` trigger fires.
2. The `update_uq_metrics` function calculates UQ metrics by averaging `Test_Value`s and computing the standard deviation and reliability index.
3. The function then updates or inserts the UQ metrics in `UQ_Results` for the corresponding `Source_ID`.

---

### 4. **Data Export for ArcGIS Module**

**Purpose**:
Exports data from PostgreSQL to a CSV file for use in ArcGIS.

**Key Script**:
- **`export_data_for_arcgis.py`**: Exports data with UQ metrics to a CSV format compatible with ArcGIS.

**Data Flow**:
1. **User runs `export_data_for_arcgis.py`**, which connects to the database and retrieves data from the necessary tables.
2. The script outputs the data into `data_with_uq_for_arcgis.csv`, including fields like `Source_ID`, `Mean_Value`, 
`Standard_Deviation`, and `Reliability_Index`.
3. The CSV file can then be uploaded to ArcGIS Online or ArcGIS Pro for visualization.

---

### 5. **Visualization and Outlier Detection Module**

**Purpose**:
Visualizes data distributions and identifies outliers in `Test_Value`.

**Key Script**:
- **`visualize_and_detect_outliers.py`**: Generates histograms and box plots to visualize `Test_Value` distribution and detects outliers.

**Data Flow**:
1. **User runs `visualize_and_detect_outliers.py`**, which retrieves `Test_Value` data from `Material_Quality`.
2. The script plots the data and applies statistical methods to identify potential outliers.
3. Results include visual output and printed information on any outliers detected, which can help identify data quality issues.

### Notes & Explanation
The **Reliability Index** is a metric that provides a measure of the consistency or reliability of the test values in the 
dataset, in this case, from the `Material_Quality` table. Here’s a detailed interpretation of what the calculated reliability 
index of approximately **8.76** signifies.

### Understanding the Reliability Index Calculation

The Reliability Index is calculated as:

\[
\text{Reliability Index} = \frac{\text{Mean Value}}{\text{Standard Deviation}}
\]

For your dataset:
- **Mean Test Value** ≈ 25.25
- **Standard Deviation** ≈ 2.88
- **Reliability Index** ≈ 8.76

### Interpretation of Reliability Index

1. **Relative Consistency of Test Values**:
   - The Reliability Index reflects the ratio of the mean (average) test value to the variation (standard deviation) of those values.
   - A **higher Reliability Index** indicates that the test values are more clustered around the mean, with less variability relative 
   to the mean. In other words, there is greater consistency in the material properties being measured.
   - In this case, the value of 8.76 suggests **relatively low variability** in the dataset: test values tend to be close to the mean, 
   implying consistency in material quality for this sample.

2. **Interpretation of Specific Values**:
   - Generally:
     - **Higher Values (e.g., >5)**: Indicative of high reliability and low relative variability. Materials are more consistent, 
	 which may imply higher quality control in the sample.
     - **Lower Values (e.g., <3)**: Suggests greater variability relative to the mean, implying less consistent material quality.

3. **Practical Implications in Material Quality**:
   - A high reliability index is often desired in material testing, as it implies that the material properties are consistent and 
   predictable. This can be crucial in construction and infrastructure projects where consistency in material quality impacts 
   structural integrity, durability, and performance.
   - For the `Material_Quality` data:
     - A reliability index of 8.76 suggests that the material quality is quite reliable, with test values deviating little from the mean.

4. **Limitations of the Reliability Index**:
   - While a high Reliability Index indicates low variability, it doesn’t provide information about the suitability of the mean value 
   itself. For example, a consistent material property with a high reliability index might still fall outside required specifications.
   - The Reliability Index also doesn’t specify the nature of any extreme values or outliers that may be present. Further analysis, 
   such as a histogram or box plot, could help visualize the distribution of test values.

### Summary

A **Reliability Index of 8.76** implies that:
- The `Material_Quality` values are relatively consistent and reliable, with low variability around the mean value.
- This suggests predictable behavior of the material based on the tested property, which is often desirable for ensuring uniform 
material quality in practical applications.
